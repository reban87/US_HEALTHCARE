## Summary: Physician Payment Model - Fee-for-Service (FFS)

### Overview of Fee-for-Service (FFS)
- Physicians are paid for each service provided to a patient.  
- Each service, such as an office visit, test, or procedure, is billed separately to the insurer.  
- Known as **pay-for-volume**: more services rendered result in higher pay.

### Fee Schedule in FFS
- A **fee schedule** lists all services a physician can provide with associated payment amounts.  
  - Insurers use the **allowed amount** or **negotiated rate** for payment.  
- Billing process:  
  1. Physician submits a bill for a service.  
  2. Insurer pays the lesser of the charged amount or the allowed amount.  
- Bills often include:  
  - Service or procedure details.  
  - Patient diagnoses or health conditions.  
  - Dates and locations of services.

### Retrospective Payment System
- FFS is considered **retrospective** since payment is determined after services are delivered.  
- Payment depends on the type and number of services provided.  

---

### Charges vs. Payments
- **Charges**: Amounts physicians list for their services (e.g., charge master).  
- **Payments**: Actual amounts reimbursed by insurers, often lower than charges.  
- Key distinction for studying fund flows and payment systems.

### Lessons and Considerations
- Bills provide valuable data for analyzing healthcare systems and payment structures.  
- Real-world variations exist; each scenario may require specific investigation.
