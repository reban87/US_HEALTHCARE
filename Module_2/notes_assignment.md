## Physician Practices Overview

- Central to healthcare systems and offer insights into service delivery and financial arrangements.
- Organized as independent entities (private ownership) or government-operated entities (varies by country).

### Types of Physician Practices

- Variation in practice size, ownership structure, and management.
- Ranges from solo practices (single physician) to large organizations with hundreds or thousands of physicians.

### Ownership Structure

- Smaller practices: commonly physician-owned (self-employed or partnerships).

- Larger practices: corporate ownership structures; physicians more often employees than owners.

### Management and Staffing

- Smaller practices: physicians manage the practice directly, hire basic staff, and use contractors or consultants.

- Larger practices: complex management structures with specialized departments (e.g., billing, IT, marketing, legal, HR).

## Resource Differences

- Small practices: limited resources but can perform well in essential functions.

- Large practices: resource advantages enabling sophisticated operations and infrastructure.

## Specialization

- Smaller practices: often single-specialty.
- Larger practices: more likely multi-specialty with diverse physician expertise.

## Additional Services and Locations

- Larger practices often provide in-house services (e.g., imaging, labs).
- Larger organizations may have multiple locations serving different communities.

## Significance

- Variation in practices reflects different methods of delivering medical care.
- Impacts physician interactions with intermediaries and financial flows in healthcare systems.

## Fee for Service 
## Capitation 

### question: 
Briefly describe a fee-for-service and a capitated physician payment model. Can you name one reason a physician might prefer each?

Answer: Physicians are mainly paid in the US either through a fee-for-service (FFS) system, in which they are paid for each specific service given, or through a capitation model, in which they are given a panel of patients and paid a sum of money to handle those patients’ care for a given time period, regardless of services rendered during that time. Physicians might prefer that in FFS, they are incentivized to provide any care that is indicated for a patient, regardless of cost or quantity. They may also like that they do not take on any financial risk for the patients they serve. In capitation, physicians may like that they are incentivized to invest more in preventative services that will decrease a patient’s care needs over a longer time period and that they might feel a financial incentive to use services that might be considered unnecessary.
