# Question 1

What are the two general kinds of intermediaries that do risk-pooling in the US healthcare system? Describe at least one important difference between them.

Answer 1: Insurance companies and government/government programs. Insurance companies sell insurance policies to their enrollees, who pay the insurance company a premium to be covered under that policy. Governments collect funds, either through the tax system or via a premium system, and use those funds to cover the health costs for a group of people.

# Question:
Name one challenge for quality of care in the US and give an example.
    
    Correct answers to this question could describe challenges in different ways.  One useful framework is the overuse, underuse, and misuse framework.  Any of these three could be areas of challenge, and there are examples in each area.

    Underuse: People donâ€™t use enough of a beneficial service (e.g. vaccines).

    Overuse: Services that only have value for some patients are used by others as well (e.g. MRI scans are given to every person who comes to the emergency department for back pain).

    Misuse: Giving a patient a service when it is not indicated (e.g. giving blood thinners to patient in whom they are contraindicated).
